# CCNA — Networking Fundamentals

This section documents my practical learning and labs from CCNA concepts.

The focus here is to understand how networks actually work at packet level using:
- Packet Tracer labs
- Diagrams
- Real troubleshooting scenarios

Topics covered in this section include:

- OSI vs TCP/IP with real packet flow
- What happens when you ping a device
- Subnetting methods and IP planning
- VLAN and Inter-VLAN routing
- Access Control Lists (ACL)

Each post is written from hands-on practice and lab experimentation.
