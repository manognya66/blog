# CCNA — Networking Fundamentals

This section documents my practical learning and labs from CCNA concepts.

The focus here is to understand how networks actually work at packet level using:
- Packet Tracer labs
- Diagrams
- Real troubleshooting scenarios

Each post is written from hands-on practice and lab experimentation.
