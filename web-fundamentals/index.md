## What is Burp Suite?

**Burp Suite** is a web application security testing tool that acts as an intercepting proxy between a browser and a web server. It allows security testers to capture, inspect, and modify HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses in real time.

By observing this raw traffic, we can understand how browsers communicate with servers, identify hidden data like cookies and headers, and analyze how web applications handle user input.

This ability to intercept and analyze requests makes Burp Suite a fundamental tool for learning and performing web application security testing.
